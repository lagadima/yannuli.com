<h4>A 5-day design sprint that challenges procrastination to a duel.</h4>

<p><img alt="Procrastino" title="Procrastino" src="../../images/design/p-0.png"></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-8 columns">
<p>Procrastino is <b>a simple task management app that I designed in 5 days</b>, and refined for months. This app aims to share best task management methods (like Work Breakdown Structure) with procrastinators, and make those methods easy and delightful to conduct on a daily basis. Core features include “breakdown a task”, “build daily task list” and “get reward for completing a task”.</p>
<p>This is a personal project I did out of my serious interest in time/task management. I gained help for literature review, users research and testing from many people, which made me again in love with product design - it’s wonderful to connect with people and create something that makes me proud!</p>
</div>

<div class="large-4 columns">

<h2>Procrastination is killing us</h2>

<p>The start of  2018 was turbulent for me - I was one hour late to the final of a class because I waited until the last minute to print out my notes.  Procrastination ! This little demon smashed me several times throughout my life- when I tried to study for GRE, to do my internship, to build my website and etc. It looks like when a long-term task, aka huge task, confronts, I surrender naturally to procrastination.</p>

<p> Am I the lone victim of procrastination? Obviously not (just look at those procrastination memes everywhere online). Thus, I decided to challenge procrastination to a duel with the power of design.</p>


<h2>What is challenging here?</h2>

<p><img alt="methods" title="methods" src="../../images/design/prm.png"></p>

<h3>Literature review</h3>

<p>With the help from my friend who majors in psychology, I conducted an exhaustive research on procrastination as a psychological phenomenon. Papers and essays provided me with huge user groups that have been well studied, from which I learned the cognitive root of the procrastination syndrome and were able to collect a decent amount of insights from academic field.</p>

<p>Insights include</p>
	<p class="large-12 columns">- Clarify your goals</p>
	<p class="large-6 columns">- Subdividing the huge task into smaller ones
		<li>Setting deadlines for each subdivided task</li>
		<li>Make sure these smaller tasks are practical</li></p> 
    <p class="large-12 columns">- Reward yourself for every steps ahead. </p>
    <p class="large-6 columns">- Improve perception of the time
	<li>The future must feel imminent to energize action, substantiate the deadline with perceivable notions</li></p>
	<p class="large-12 columns">- Social involvement: make public promise and let your friends keep an eye on it for you</p>

<h3>Storyboarding on myself</h3>

<p>My initial exploration into the battlefield was on myself. To understand what exactly I was doing when I procrastinated, I outlined my own process of tackling a task, creating a storyboard to highlight the problems that stumbled me.</p>
		  <p><img alt="storyboard" src="../../images/design/p-2.png"></p>
		  <p>I found my problems include </p>
<p><li>The fear to start a huge task because I don’t know where to start.</li>
	<li>The intentional ignorance of the time left from the deadline.</li></p> 

<h3>Interview</h3>
<p>To broaden my horizon on the problem, I conducted online video interviews with 5 people in my network. In terms of recruiting interviewees, I consider their different lifestyles (fast/slow paced), occupations and field of study to diversify my sample library. <b>I invited them to describe their most recent experience finishing a huge task.</b> 
</p>
		  <p>In the directed storytelling process, I made sure to touch two core questions</p> 
	<p><li>their current task managing methodology</li> 
		<li>their expected task managing flow (what they can do better)</li></p>
	
<h3>Personas and journey map</h3>

<p>Synthesizing the data, I found users’ behaviors vary hugely in accordance with their different levels of task management skills. Therefore, I built two Personas to identify users with different levels of task-managing ability and their respective needs.</p>

            <label class="image-caption">the mvp procrastinator</label>

            <label class="image-caption">the highly efficient player</label>
          </div>
     </div>    
<p>I built a journey map analysing a task managing flow, highlighting untouched pain points. As the two share the same workflow with overlapping pain points, I combined their journeys into one map.</p>

<p><a href="../../images/design/pjm-f.png" class="fluidbox"><img alt="Procrastino" title="Procrastino" src="../../images/design/pjm.jpg"></a></p>

<h3>Key pain points</h3>

<p>Analizing the research findings, I identified the key pain points </p>


<h2>Why do we need yet another task management tool?</h2>

<p>I checked the current market and found it is already well occupied, but victims of procrastination still failed in the battle, what caused these failure? </p>

<p><img alt="Procrastino" title="Procrastino" src="../../images/design/p-6.png"></p>

<p>From the competitive analysis, I identify the missing part</p>

<p>- Separation: Task management apps and platforms are usually combined with time management but seperated from task breakdown tool, resulting that users use several tools to manage a task.</p>

<p>- Steep learning curve: While users expect an efficient method to manage time and task, existing tools are complicated and thus difficult to use.</p>

<h2>Ideation</h2>

<h3>Translating pain points into goals</h3>
<p>Feature 1: Break down a task into subtasks</p>
<p>Feature 2: Directly manage the subtasks: estimate time needed for completion to set up deadlines for every subtask; build daily schedule based on the estimated time and deadline.</p>
<p>Feature 3: Dynamically remind users of how long they have till the deadline and how much of the task they have completed.</p>
<p>Feature 4: Reward the users with gamified elements that they can share with friends.</p>

<h3>And goals into functions</h3>

<p>Keeping the requirements I distilled from the research in mind, I drew a sitemap to map out the basic layout of the functions I wanted to include in this App and designed the user flow.</p>

<p><img alt="Procrastino" title="Procrastino" src="../../images/design/psm.png"></p>

<h2>Sketching, quick user testing and iterating</h2>

<p>With the guide of the sitemap, I sketched rough prototypes on iPad pro and walked through the user flow with potential users.</p>

<h2>Final prototype</h2>

<p>After the iterations, I created high-fidelity prototypes and decided the final user flow of Procrastino.</p>

<div class="large-6 columns">
<h3 class="row--top">The simpler, the better</h3>

<p>Users can breakdown the giant task and manage the subtasks on daily basis by simply following the workflow. The flow simplifies both the task breakdown process and daily task assignment process.</p>

<p class="large-6 columns row--top">The time users can assign to tasks is also simplified into pomos. Pomo time feature makes it easy to keep on track.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h3 class="large-8 columns row--top">Dynamic reminders</h3>

<p class="large-6 columns">Daily pop-up reminders and percentage management always keep users aware of how far they are away from finishing the task, countdown to the task keeps users alerted.</p>

<div class="large-6 columns">
<h3 class="row--top">Go to work and have fun</h3>

<p>Inspired by Little Prince, I brought in gamification element: a story of fighting against task trees to protect your planet. Users can share daily achievements, the planet saved from the task and the growing universe to social media. To maximize the support of social involvement, users can also share their daily schedule to keep their friends updated of the task.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
   
   <p>Having been an official HCI student for 2 months, I looked back at this personal project and found a lot of work still needs to be done.</p>
    
    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
    <p>Conduct usability testing with an interactive prototype, use cognitive walkthrough method to discover if users’ actions meet the design intention. Iterate the prototypes with the data and adjust the design.</p>
    <p>Features need further testings include:</p>
    <p><li>The wording of task attributes: timeframe, POMO etc needs more legibility testing to make sure the design speaks the same language as users.</li>
    	<li>Recoverability in the task breaking down flow: I need to reconsider how to instruct users to breakdown the tasks while give them enough freedom to customize.</li></p>
    <h3>Evaluation metrics</h3>
    <p>Decide the metrics to evaluate the success of this product. Consider how to measure if the product is helpful. Explore the business model for a product like this.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	<p>I did the project in a hackathon style - in 5 days, I conducted user research, built low-fi prototypes and iterated rapidly with usability testing. Finally, I created hi-fi prototypes with Sketch, Adobe illustrator and Principle. I learned a lot from this personal project.</p>
    
     <p>The whole project is about keeping the balance between users’ agency, making things easy and providing the best workflow. I have to not only think about the best solution/workflow of defeating procrastination but also how to make the solution easy to access and persist on a daily basis. </p>
     
     <p>During the project, I found bringing in users’ thoughts at different stages always helped me to generate refined ideas. There looks no need to wait until the prototype for testing, always ask users when you feel unsure. It’s really important to learn from users!</p>
