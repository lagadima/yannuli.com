<h4>A platform that enables communication and decision-making in a crowd.</h4>

<h2>The challenge</h2>

<p><a href="https://taguxdesign.com/fan_v2.html">Folding fan</a> is the second app of tag UX Designâ€™s Chinese artisan series, bringing traditional folding fans back to sight via 3D models, strong visual design and interaction. Released in July 2017, Folding fan was right away recommended by Apple, occupying the front page of app store. It gained more than 0.4 million downloads. </p>

<p>However, on a public event featuring Folding fan, a lady questioned our founder about this appâ€™s usability, saying â€œI totally did not understand how to play with it, are we the old already left behind the technology? â€œIn fact, she was not alone: after the storming downloads across the first months, Folding fan is getting less and less increasing users and the retention is only 6% from July to October. The sales of the fans displayed within the store section of the app is also low.</p>

<p>I joined the team as a solo ux designer to tackle this problem by redesigning the user experience, working with visual designers and engineers to iterate the app.</p>

<h2>User research to locate problems</h2>

<p>I started with collecting 150 pieces of negative feedback from both the post portal and app store reviews. The data were immense, ecletic and chaotic so that I categorized the major problems with an Elito.</p>

<p>To map the iteration clearly, I used severity rating to locate the most serious problems. </p>

<p>With an overall idea of the problems in head, I conducted four usability testings to gain the first-hand user scenario. In each test, I asked the users to speak aloud their minds and reasons of their meticulous decisions including gesture choices. During the test, I carefully avoided giving out instructions or directly answering questions, instead, I asked for users' motivations, habits, and past experience to guide them through some puzzling point. I made a detailed record of both the comments and the experience, finding that unusual gestures without instructions, ambiguous guides and implications in Folding Fan made users at loss. In one month, I collected four usability test report and started to synthesize the information.</p>

<p>Users' difficulties and comments were again messy so I also used severity rating to summarize them. I distilled three insights from all the data, and identified major problems.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>

<p>To encompass the design process and validate my design with my teammates, I refined three insights from the data I gathered.</p>

<p><img alt="Folding Fan 1.2" title="Folding Fan 1.2" src="../../images/design/Folding Fan-2.jpg"></p>

<p>Now it is time to solve the problems.</p>

<h2>Brainstorming and validating solutions</h2>

<p>After presenting the insights I found and the problems I identify to my teammates, we meet up to brainstorm the solutions. We discussed along the sitemap and I collected 27 ideas in total regarding every meticulous problem.</p>

<p><img alt="Folding Fan 1.2" title="Folding Fan 1.2" src="../../images/design/Folding fan_4.jpg"></p>

<p>After testing the viability and primaries of the ideas, I narrow down the ideas, which will be presented in Folding fan 1.2 released in December.</p>

<h2>The outcome</h2>

<p>The changes include the following</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>- always put yourself on the same level with the users</p>
<p>- every decision needs justification</p>
<p>- communication is the base of everything</p>
