## Background

This exhibition design is a class project at UC Davis. The professor gave us great freedom in terms of the budget and location so that we could work out something that fully express our ideas and concerns.

When we initiated this project, Trump just claimed power and the world seemed more turbulent than any time. That was why we would like to convey ideas against this situation. In this consideration, we chose Picasso’s works depicting wars and peace as the exhibition topic, because we believed that Picasso should appeal to a wide range of people and that it would help people reflect upon the current issues such as rising racism, reviving fascism and so on. To clearly express our intention and add highlights to a yet another Picasso exhibition, we decided to back up Picasso’s artistic expression of war with contemporary photos depicting the same historical event.

## Substantiate the idea

The first task in designing an exhibition was to build its narrative and decide what objects are to be used. We hunted for Picasso’s works regarding war and peace following a his life timeline. The narrative is straightforward and clear: Picasso’s interpretation of 20th century’s important events would be displayed in chronological order side by side with photos illustrating the same event. 

We searched the Internet to construct our object list. Carefully avoiding works without clear attribution and copy right, we collected works to be exhibited from [Artstor](http://www.artstor.org/), [Google Arts and Culture](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/), and so on. We picked those most famous works as well as thought-provoking ones, and organized them into a narrative flow.

Specifically, the opening image was an ironic and amusing one: a photo of Picasso looking at an image of Stalin. it was both intriguing and able to bring out our theme.

## Design for better engagement

I was in charge of defining our audience of the exhibition and methods. The meticulous design details of the exhibition reminded me of how human-centered design could contribute to the communication of ideas.

I rummaged museums’ official websites including SFMOMA.org, Ashmolean.org, and so on to trace meticulous and valid design in their learning handbooks and visitor manual. I took field trips to two museums on campus and three more in San Francisco including de Young museum, SFMOMA, and Exploratorium. I wandered in the museums with a sketchbook, observing museum goers, writing down random thoughts and details I noticed that might be helpful for better interaction and engagement. Design elements that enhanced communication silently and interactive installments showing the arousing power of technology   In terms of conveying ideas and creating impulses, these human centered designs were effective yet not enforcing.

## The outcome

The exhibition proposal was presented to our professor and classmates, and was regarded as conniving and strong.
